# Kubernetes dynamic routing mesh

This repository contains a simplified workflow for provisioning a dynamic routing mesh into Kubernetes, using Consul, consul-template, Helm, and NGINX. It make use of some Kubernetes primitives, namely Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps. 

Originally created by me as a presentation for the Vancouver Kubernetes meetup. We use something similar (albeit more sophisticated) at my employer (Hootsuite).
